    Abstract: "Extreme poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, poor law enforcement, and open border between India and Nepal are major factors for human trafficking. Due to the devastating earthquake that hit Nepal on April 25, 2015, which was followed by more than 400 aftershocks, about 3 million people were victimized. The earthquake victims- women and children, were more vulnerable to trafficking than before. Hence, it is vital to understand human trafficking, its form, factors, effects, and motives. The objective of this paper is to make intellectuals aware of the issue of sex trafficking, problems, and possible solutions in Nepal.",

    Year: null,
    Tags: null,
    Abstract: "The use of collaborations and partnerships that engage a variety of actors from both the public and private spheres has drawn attention during the last decade as a promising strategy for combatting trafficking and improving assistance to victims of trafficking. This article investigates the Swedish Civil Society Platform against Human Trafficking as an example of successful collaboration between civil society actors. The aim is to explore how the platform as a distinct organizational form is capable of dealing productively with some of the challenges facing internal and external collaboration. We utilize interviews with key actors and a study of policy documents as we argue that the modularity and flexibility of the platform organizational form are key factors in its success. While it is a robust type of organization that may be regarded as a trustworthy partner, it also permits its member organizations to continue functioning as independent entities.",

    Title: "Exploring Private Investigation Agencies’ Experience of Collaboration with Law Enforcement in Investigations of Human Trafficking Cases",
    Authors: "Charles Hounmenou, Sachi Toepp",
    Year: "2023",
    Tags: null,
    Abstract: "In their forefront role to address human trafﬁcking, law enforcement agencies (LEAs) have often faced challenges in efforts to investigate this crime. Non-traditional partnerships should be explored to improve strategies to investigate human trafﬁcking. Could private investigation agencies (PIAs) collaborate with LEAs to help improve human trafﬁcking investigations? The present study examines PIAs’ experiences of collaboration with LEAs for human trafﬁcking investigations. A mixed research method design was used. Purposive sampling was used to select 81 participants representing 81 PIAs for a survey. Follow-up semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 of the 39 survey participants who reported that their agencies had collaborated with LEAs for human trafﬁcking investigations. The ﬁndings show varying levels of success and challenges for PIAs in interagency collaboration with LEAs. The challenges to collaboration identiﬁed could be mostly explained by LEAs’ misperceptions of private investigators, their over-reliance on a criminal approach instead of a victim-centered one in investigating trafﬁcking cases and recovering victims, and legal or ethical limitations. Positive aspects of PIA–LEA partnerships regarding human trafﬁcking investigations were discussed and so were strategies to address inherent challenges to interagency collaboration. Several policy implications were discussed for developing and improving partnership initiatives with law enforcement in an effort to prevent human trafﬁcking, protect victims, and prosecute trafﬁcking cases.",

    Abstract: "Conclusion: Fishermen in this region are exposed to very serious risks to their health and safety, and their illnesses and injuries often go untreated. Men who enter the fishing industry in Thailand, especially migrant workers, require safe working conditions and targeted protections from human trafficking. Survivors of the crime of sea slavery must be provided with the compensation they deserve and the care they need, especially psychological support.",

    Authors: "Graham Ellison, Ronald Weitzer",
    Year: null,
    Tags: null,
    Abstract: "Studies of male sex workers are often confined to the individual level, rather than examining their work environment per se or the larger social ecology in which their business activities are embedded. We know relatively little, for example, about the spatial location of erotic worksites (apart from street-level work) or the interactional dynamics of sellers and clients within such settings. This paper is based on an ethnographic study of bars and clubs in Prague and Berlin where male sexual commerce is transacted. We find considerable differences between the cities in the social organization of these bars and in participants’ demographic characteristics. The analysis links our micro-level findings to the larger forces of economic migration and sex tourism, factors that differ between the two cases.",

    Title: "Worker feedback technologies and combatting modern slavery in global supply chains: examining the effectiveness of remediation-oriented and due-diligence-oriented technologies in identifying and addressing forced labour and human trafficking",
    Authors: "Lisa Rende Taylor, Elena Shih",
    Year: "2018",
    Tags: null,
    Abstract: "The global proliferation of mobile-phone-based technologies in countries producing goods for global export—including SMS, smartphone apps, hotlines, polls, and other methods—offers exciting opportunities for collecting worker feedback to support corporate responsible sourcing. This seven-country study analysed how such technologies vary based on their fundamental relationships with workers and with businesses, and their commitments to workers and business, which leads to varying impacts on workers’ lives. Due-diligence-oriented technology tools were found to help control risk in supply-chain hot spots, but rarely identified modern slavery due to gaining little trust from workers, and business clients not being ready to expose or address modern slavery. Empowerment-oriented worker feedback tools were found to regularly identify modern slavery, forced labour, and human trafficking and to assist exploited workers, but most had no connection to business’s due diligence. Key ethical concerns were exposed as well, including the burden that some technology tools place on worker respondents, with insufficient benefits and safeguards to those vulnerable informant populations.",

    Authors: "Patrick L. Kerr, Gavin Bryant",
    Year: null,
    Tags: null,
    Abstract: "Objectives: People experiencing trafficking often seek health care but are not identified. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added new International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes specific to human trafficking (hereinafter, HT ICD-10-CM codes) that could systematize the identification and documentation of human trafficking in US health care settings, the extent of their use is unknown. The objectives of this study were to investigate (1) the frequency of HT ICD-10-CM code use in US health care organizations (HCOs) and (2) demographic data associated with HT ICD-10-CM codes using a large clinical database.\nMethods: This retrospective study used deidentified data collected from October 1, 2018, through March 30, 2021, from a clinical database (N = 69 740 144 patients) network (TriNetX) of 48 collaborating US HCOs. Data included number of patients with ≥1 HT ICD-10-CM code, diagnoses, and demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and region).\nResults: HT ICD-10-CM codes were associated with 298 patients in US HCOs, most of whom were young (mean [SD] age, 26 [16] y), White (53.0%; n = 158), and female (87.9%; n = 262). Thirty-seven of 48 (77.1%) participating HCOs used ≥1 HT ICD-10-CM code. The most frequently used HT ICD-10-CM codes were “forced sexual exploitation, suspected” (32.2%; n = 96) and “personal history of forced labor or sexual exploitation” (27.1%; n = 81). Labor trafficking codes were noted in approximately 3.7% of cases.\nConclusions: HT ICD-10-CM codes are being used by health care professionals, as confirmed by large databases. Further research is needed to understand variation in code use and risk factors associated with human trafficking.",

    Abstract: "In this article, we present and discuss the intended and unintended effects of the Swedish Sex Purchase Act, which criminalises the purchase of sex within a context where the sale of sex is legal. Whether or not this means of regulating prostitution is successful, and whether it has negative consequences for people who sell sex, are important questions in international policy and academic debates. This article builds on a scoping study aimed at identifying relevant sources of information as to the consequences of the Swedish Sex Purchase Act, then summarising and discussing these findings. The article offers policy makers and scholars a comprehensive presentation of the evidence and a discussion of the methodological, political and theoretical challenges arising from this.",

    Abstract: "Child sex trafﬁcking and adult women involved in street-based prostitution are two problems affecting the city of Toledo, Ohio. While various agencies worked independently to address these problems, there was no collaborative effort. We decided to organize a year-long roundtable that included people from Toledo-based social service, criminal justice, and health care systems, as well as concerned citizens, church groups, and survivors of prostitution. Our intent was to develop responses that were speciﬁc and sensitive not only to the needs of prostituted women and trafﬁcked teens, but also to service providers and members of the community. In this article, we report on our project, its accomplishments, and lessons learned.",

    Authors: "Alinka Gearon",
    Year: "2015",
    Tags: "Mental Health, Social Work",
    Abstract: "‘Child trafficking’ has recently been critically positioned within moral panic theory by authors such as Westwood (2010) and Cree et al. (2014) making links between historical and present day presentations of this social issue. This paper contributes to this discussion but is distinct in its central concern; how separated and moving children and young people experience the present UK ‘child trafficking’ framework, in the midst of moral panic. Moral panics create conditions of blame, disrepute and loss, which this paper explores in relation to ‘child trafficking’ policy and practice and considersthe implications for trafficked children. (Non-)contemporary concepts of childhood underpinning the ‘child trafficking’ framework are examined, which posit children and childhood dichotomously as either innocent and lost, passive to abuse and wholly dependent on adult protection or as complicit, undeserving threats. In ‘child trafficking’ policy and practice, these constructs variably punish or ‘protect’ children, failing to address this group of children’s needs.In the current climate of moral panics about social phenomena that seemingly threaten our social fabric and moral order (Critcher, 2009) through ‘enacted melodramas’ (Wright, 2015), social work research needs to critically engage with ‘claims-makers’ (Clapton et al., 2013) and present alternative renderings of social problems. This paper argues that social work research is well placed to redress moral panics through its activity in engaging ethically with people who are marginalised with difficult social problem",

    Tags: "Social Work",
    Abstract: "This article examines the intersection of state policies, private brokers and local employers that fuels trafficking practices and forced labor of legal labor migrants. Focusing on the Israeli case of labor migration, we offer a meso-level institutional analysis of the modes by which private brokers\'s actions combine with state regulations and policies in creating labor trafficking. More specifically, we stress the active role official labor migration schemes play in the growth of a private brokerage sector driven by profit considerations and in the privatization of state capacities regarding migration control and management. Our analysis demonstrates how systemic features – and not necessarily or solely criminal activities – catalyze trafficking practices taking place first and foremost within the realm of legal migration.",

    Abstract: "This article describes the Engage, Motivate, Protect, Organize, self-Worth, Educate, Respect (EMPOWER) Clinic for Survivors of Sex Trafficking and Sexual Violence located at Gouverneur Health in New York, New York, as a model for integrated gynecologic and psychiatric care of survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. Although patients with a history of sexual trauma often have critical health needs that persist long after the traumatic event, most existing services for survivors of sexual violence focus solely on the provision of acute care immediately after the violence has occurred. There are very few clinics in the United States dedicated to managing the significant long-term medical consequences and sequelae of sexual violence in a trauma-informed setting. We report on best practices for the provision of trauma-sensitive medical care to this patient population based on those employed at the EMPOWER Clinic. In particular, we outline some of the unique considerations for treating survivors relating to taking a patient history, conducting the physical and gynecologic examinations, ensuring confidentiality, and managing legal issues. Finally, we reflect on the challenges faced in sustaining the EMPOWER Clinic and the importance of the existence of a clinic dedicated to this specific population.",

    Title: "Raising awareness of human trafficking in key professional fields via a multidisciplinary educational approach",

    Abstract: "Purpose Human trafficking (HT) for sex and labor services is among the fastest growing criminal enterprises, causing significant physical and psychological morbidity to victims. Although many survivors encounter medical, legal and social work professionals during their captivity, lack of awareness of HT in these fields results in under-recognition of victims. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary educational conference on raising awareness of HT in these fields. Design/methodology/approach A single-day educational conference on HT was hosted in Miami, Florida. Participants were recruited from medical, law enforcement, social work and political fields. The research team issued a ten-item HT survey at the start and end of the conference. Results were analyzed for improvement in survey score using an exact Wilcoxon sign rank test. The results were analyzed both as a single cohort and stratified by profession. Findings For all participants, there was a significant improvement in post-survey score (0.355, p < 0.05). When stratified by profession, significant improvement was noted in the legal subgroup (0.561, p < 0.05). No significant changes were noted for the other individual professional cohorts, although all subgroups trended toward improvement. Research limitations/implications A multi-disciplinary educational conference may be effective in raising awareness of HT. Further research is needed to determine the effect of increased awareness on actual outcomes for trafficking survivors. Originality/value This study represents unique, original research which provides valuable data as to the effectiveness of educational conferences on raising awareness of HT for professionals with the best opportunity to make meaningful interventions.",

    Title: "“Spotting the signs” of trafficking recruitment online: exploring the characteristics of advertisements targeted at migrant job-seekers",
    Authors: "Ada Volodko, Ella Cockbain, Bennett Kleinberg",

    Tags: "Law Enforcement, Public Policy, Social Work",
    Abstract: "Despite considerable concern about how human trafficking offenders may use the Internet to recruit their victims, arrange logistics or advertise services, the Internet-trafficking nexus remains unclear. This study explored the prevalence and correlates of a set of commonly-used indicators of labour trafficking in online job advertisements. Taking a case study approach, we focused on a major Lithuanian website aimed at people seeking work abroad. We examined a snapshot of job advertisements (n = 430), assessing both their general characteristics (e.g. industry, destination country) and the presence of trafficking indicators. The vast majority (98.4%) contained at least one indicator, suggesting certain \"indicators\" may in fact be commonplace characteristics of this labour market. Inferential statistical tests revealed significant but weak relationships between the advertisements’ characteristics and the number and nature of indicators present. While there may be value in screening job advertisements to identify potential labour trafficking and exploitation, additional information is needed to ascertain actual labour trafficking. We conclude with an outlook on automated approaches to identifying cases of possible trafficking and a discussion of the benefits and ethical concerns of a data science-driven approach.",

    Year: "2018",
    Tags: "Healthcare, Mental Health, Social Work",
    Abstract: "Human trafficking, also known as modern-day slavery, is an egregious human rights violation associated with wide-ranging medical and mental health consequences. Because of the extensive health problems related to trafficking, health care providers play a critical role in identifying survivors and engaging them in ongoing care. Although guidelines for recognizing affected patients and a framework for developing response protocols in health care settings have been described, survivors\' ongoing engagement in health care services is very challenging. High rates of disengagement, lost contact, premature termination, and attrition are common outcomes. For interventions to be effective in this marginalized population, challenges in engaging survivors in long-term therapeutic primary and mental health care must be better understood and overcome. This article uses the socioecological model of public health to identify barriers to engagement; offers evidence- and practice-based recommendations for overcoming these barriers; and proposes an interdisciplinary call to action for developing more flexible, adaptable models of care.",
